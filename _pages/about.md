I am a PhD student working in the *Rigorous Software Engineering Group* under the supervision of [Maria Christakis](https://mariachris.github.io).
My interests lie in Automated Testing, Metamorphic Testing and (Static) Program Analysis. Recently my focus was challanging testing domains in program analysis such as
program analyzers that reason about rachability, CHC solvers and Termination Checkers.
